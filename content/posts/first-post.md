Hey! I'm Matt. As of now, I'm starting my website after leaving Palantir.
Currently, I am on a gap year from Stanford, I recently started my company, Poth, 
and got funded by YC! My co-founder, Mojmir, is currently a senior at Andover, so we're
deferring our YC batch until Summer 2026.

You'll find me writing about anything and everything! Right now I'm interested in logic and epistemology - trying to read more
books there. I'm interested in how and why we think what we think.
